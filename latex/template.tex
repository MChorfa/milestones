\section{TRL-Specific Considerations}

\subsection{TRL 1-3 (Basic Research and Proof of Concept)}
Focus on theoretical foundations and basic experimental proof of concept. Minimal infrastructure requirements, mostly centered on research tools and data analysis.

\subsection{TRL 4-6 (Technology Development and Demonstration)}
Transition from theoretical to practical application. Emphasize prototyping, testing in relevant environments, and integration of components.

\subsection{TRL 7-9 (System Development and Deployment)}
Emphasis on full-scale prototypes, operational testing, and final system deployment. Rigorous project management, compliance, and operational considerations.
