ðŸ”§ **A Practical Milestone Template for TRL 1-9 Projects: Bridging the Gap Between Research and Full Deployment** ðŸš€

Managing projects across Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) can be a chaotic and fragmented process. After years of struggling with this, Iâ€™ve built a milestone template designed to streamline transitions from TRL 1 (research) to TRL 9 (full deployment).

ðŸ“Œ **Key Benefits:**
- Adapts to your projectâ€™s growth across TRLs
- Integrates AI tools for resource allocation, risk analysis, and compliance
- Ensures security and compliance from day one

ðŸ“ˆ Whether youâ€™re in basic research or scaling up for deployment, this template has you covered with:
- Streamlined metadata and TRL-specific sections
- AI-powered risk forecasting and predictive analytics
- Continuous compliance and security audits
