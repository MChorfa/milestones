# Project Milestone Template for TRL 1-9 Projects

## 1. TRL-Specific Considerations

### TRL 1-3 (Basic Research and Proof of Concept)

Focus on theoretical foundations and basic experimental proof of concept. Minimal infrastructure requirements, mostly centered on research tools and data analysis.

### TRL 4-6 (Technology Development and Demonstration)

Transition from theoretical to practical application. Emphasize prototyping, testing in relevant environments, and integration of components.

### TRL 7-9 (System Development and Deployment)

Emphasis on full-scale prototypes, operational testing, and final system deployment. Rigorous project management, compliance, and operational considerations.
